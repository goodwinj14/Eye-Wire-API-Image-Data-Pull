# EyeWireAPI_Image_Data_Pull
Simple Python script to pull image stacks from the EyeWire API, auto-generate sub directories and save the images accordingly 
After downloading the python script the first thing you must do befor running it is create the folder that will hold all the data. Running the script once will gennerate 1024 images so you want to make sure these are being put into a folder somerwhere and are not just thrown onto your desktop. 

After you have created this folder, open the getImages.py script.
